Simple Android game written in [Defold game engine](https://defold.com/). It is a simple catch 'em
up game where you have to catch as many insects as you can. The game is intended for kids with eye
disorders, the background is intentionally difficult on the eyes and forces the eyes to "work more"
and therefore helps to exercise them.

The game is a port of [React Native version of the game](https://github.com/Coffei/insectoids),
which turned out to be too slow.

## How did it go?

Once you understand the basics of Defold it goes really fast. Many things, like animations are
really easy to integrate. Compared to the react-native version, some things are unfortunatelly more
difficult, like detecting clicks on the insect sprites. However,
[Rendercam](https://github.com/rgrams/rendercam) extension helped tremendously with that.

This version differs slightly from the previous one, some new sprites were added and primarily
sounds and music were added.

## What about the health benefits?

First a disclaimer, I am NOT a doctor, nor have I discussed this app with one. However, this game
uses basic principles that are used in professional optometric games. Unfortunately, these games
are not available for purchase or are quite expensive, so I decided to write something similar.
